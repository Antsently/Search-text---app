"# Search-text---app" 

This is my first work with Git, so in some moments I could be wrong. Do not judge strictly.

I decided to create an application in Delphi where you can count the number of characters in a text.

Add. functions:
1. Lowercase / uppercase letters
2. Search / replace text
3. Highlighting the text we are looking for.

I posted the entire project with the source code, as well as the release version of the application.

P.S.
You can use the application as you like, but I will forgive you not to use my code for bad purposes. Thanks.
